# MiniAgents: A Visualization Interface for Simulacra

The MiniAgents visualization tool for simulacra.

Currently only Mac is supported. The project is still work-in-progress (like a 0.5 version), I'm releasing this version because it's already functional.

Disclaimer: So far there is no novelty related to NLP research in this project, it is a tool and not a paper. It is motivated by the "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" paper.

## Quick start

Download MiniAgent.app from the following shared google folder and put it in the repo folder (same folder as this README file).

I have put the map files and a random-simulation trajectory files in ./run0/ , so you should be able to directly run. Just click the app file open and click the "Go!" button.

## Run your own simulation

I give a minimal example of how simulation trajectories can be generated for this visualization interface.

The minimal setting only requires python3.11.
